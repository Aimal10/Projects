## Hotel Reservation Predictive Model
Project Overview
- This project aims to develop a predictive model for hotel reservations using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes hotel booking patterns to predict future reservations. This repository contains the code and datasets used in the project, along with detailed documentation of the methodologies and results.

Installation
- To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
Statsmodels
To install these libraries, use the following command:

- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels


Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone [repository-link]

Navigate to the project directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to see the analysis and model in action.


Methodology
- This project follows these key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to identify patterns and relationships.
3. Model Development: Building and training Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM models.
4. Model Evaluation: Comparing models based on accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Enhancing model performance through hyperparameter optimization.
6. Results: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model showed the best performance with an accuracy of 81.71% and an F1 score of 86.65%. Detailed results of all models are documented in the project notebooks.
